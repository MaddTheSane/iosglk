This is source code for an implementation of the Glk library for iOS.
It is intended to be a basis for iOS IF applications.

For a working example, see my IosFizmo project:
<https://github.com/erkyrath/iosfizmo/>

This library is at beta-test levels. It works as far as I know, but may
contain bugs. Documentation remains sparse.
