IosGlk -- an iOS implementation of the Glk API.

IosGlk library: version 0.2.0.
Glk API which this implements: version 0.7.3.
Designed by Andrew Plotkin <erkyrath@eblong.com>

This is source code for an implementation of the Glk library for iOS.
It is intended to be a basis for iOS IF applications.

For a working example, see my IosFizmo project:
<https://github.com/erkyrath/iosfizmo/>

This library is at beta-test levels. It works as far as I know, but it has
only been tested with IosFizmo, not with the complete Glulx unit test suite.
Documentation remains sparse.
